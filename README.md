# Unet from Scratch
UNET is a neural network architecture composed of convolutions. For the sake of understanding how to create a neural network I built UNET from scratch and trained it on Carvana Data from kaggle. The youtube video that I followed for this task is listed below, as well as other links that I found useful.
